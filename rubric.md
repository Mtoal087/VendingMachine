# CS1570 Homework #3 Rubric
# Fall 2022

##### A message from the venerable Clayton Price.

> When writing code in any language, there are good coding practices and there are really bad ones. Both may be correct as far as compiling and when run, but bad code can present some problems in development, debugging, and modifying. In the workforce, no matter how well your program runs, someone will have to read and/or alter your code at some point. They may have to add new features, correct a rare bug, or just want to read it to understand how it works. Similarly, you will have to read someone else's code to do the same thing. Everyone will get along a whole lot better if the code is readable and understandable.
